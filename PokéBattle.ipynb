    "<h1 align='center'> PokéBattle Bot Analysis Notebook </h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to delve into the development and analysis of a bot designed to play Pokémon Showdown autonomously. Pokémon Showdown is a popular online battle simulator that provides a competitive platform for players to test their strategic skills in Pokémon battles. By leveraging artificial intelligence techniques, the bot simulates human decision-making, navigating complex battle scenarios to choose the most effective strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on three primary objectives. \n",
    "- First, it seeks to study the bot's main functions, uncovering how its underlying algorithms allow it to perform tasks such as predicting opponent moves, selecting optimal actions, and adapting to dynamic game conditions. \n",
    "- Second, the decision-making logic employed by the bot will be analyzed to understand the mechanisms and heuristics that drive its strategic choices. \n",
    "- Third, the project will explore how the bot evaluates potential moves and switches, emphasizing its methods for assessing battle conditions and weighing the outcomes of different actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool\n",
    "Our bot utilizes [Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/) to engage in matches with randomly generated teams, facilitated through an [API](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon Showdown is an online simulator designed for competitive Pokémon battles. It faithfully replicates the in-game battling experience and adheres to official rules and community guidelines, making it a favorite among competitive players. Accessible directly through a web browser without any downloads, Pokémon Showdown offers a quick and convenient way to battle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Players can either build custom teams by selecting their favorite Pokémon, moves, abilities, and strategies, or opt for random battles with automatically generated teams. Our bot focuses on the latter, engaging in exciting random battles to showcase its capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pokémon Showdown is a professional web platform widely used in Pokémon eSports. Renowned for its fidelity to the official competitive environment, Pokémon Showdown sets a high standard by following standardized rules and community guidelines.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Given the complexity of its advanced features and its status as a benchmark in online Pokémon battles, fully replicating the platform within a notebook is highly challenging. Instead, the notebook provides a simulation that also utilizes a genetic algorithm to optimize certain strategies. To see the actual bot in action and explore the project in detail, please refer to our [GitHub](https://github.com/MatteoPirii/PokeBattle) repository and its README file, where a comprehensive description is available.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The `find_best_move` function is a core component of the Pokémon Showdown bot. It determines the optimal action (move or switch) during each turn by employing the Minimax algorithm and considering factors such as the Pokémon's health, available moves, and the overall game state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Function Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "- To identify and execute the best possible action for the current game turn.\n",
    "- To account for both short-term and long-term consequences of each action using simulation and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Validation**\n",
    "   - Checks if the active Pokémon is alive:\n",
    "     - If **not alive**, attempts to find the best switch option.\n",
    "     - If no switches are available, returns an error or a placeholder action.\n",
    "&nbsp;          \n",
    "2. **Option Categorization**\n",
    "    - Retrieves and categorizes all available actions into **moves** and **switches** using the `options_categorization` function.\n",
    "    - Handles scenarios where switching is forced or no moves are available.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "3. **Move Evaluation with Minimax**\n",
    "   - Combines all valid moves and switches into a single list.\n",
    "   - Simulates each move using `apply_move` and evaluates its impact on the game state via the Minimax algorithm.\n",
    "   - Restores the original game state after each simulation to avoid side effects.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "4. **Final Decision**\n",
    "   - Selects the move or switch with the highest evaluated score.\n",
    "   - Formats the decision and adjusts the remaining time.\n",
    "   - Includes a fallback mechanism to randomly select an action if no optimal move is identified."

    "\n",
    "### **Function breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "To evaluate the current battle state based on various factors such as health, level, type advantage, reserves, weather, and status conditions, helping to make informed decisions during battle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "1. **Active Pokémon Status**:\n",
    "    - Assigns a large penalty if the user's active Pokémon has fainted.\n",
    "    - Assigns a high reward if the opponent's active Pokémon has fainted.\n",
    "&nbsp;  \n",
    "2. **Health and Level Difference**:\n",
    "    - Scores the difference in percentage HP between the user's and opponent's active Pokémon.\n",
    "    - Adds or subtracts points based on the level difference.\n",
    "&nbsp;  \n",
    "3. **Reserve Pokémon**:\n",
    "    - Rewards having healthy Pokémon in the user's reserves.\n",
    "    - Penalizes the opponent's healthy reserves.\n",
    "&nbsp;  \n",
    "4. **Type Advantage**:\n",
    "    - Rewards having a type advantage and penalizes type disadvantage based on a multiplier.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "5. **Weather Conditions**:\n",
    "    - Adjusts the score based on how weather impacts the user's and opponent's Pokémon.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "6. **Status Conditions**:\n",
    "    - Penalizes status conditions on the user's active Pokémon (e.g., paralysis, burn).\n",
    "    - Rewards status conditions on the opponent's active Pokémon.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "7. **Stat Boosts**:\n",
    "    - Evaluates boosts or reductions in stats, rewarding moderate boosts and penalizing extreme ones or reductions.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "8. **Healing Move Usage**:\n",
    "    - Penalizes using healing moves unnecessarily (e.g., if the user's HP is already high).\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "9. **Worst-Case Opponent Moves**:\n",
    "    - Considers the most damaging move the opponent could use and adjusts the score accordingly.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "10. **Random Tie-Breaker**:\n",
    "    - Adds a small random factor to break ties in evaluations.\n",
    "&nbsp;\n",
    "11. Returns a numerical score representing the overall battle state. A positive score indicates an advantage, while a negative score indicates a disadvantage."

    "\n",
    "#### **Minimax**\n",
    "The `minimax` function is the main entry point for the Minimax algorithm. It evaluates the game state recursively to determine the optimal action for the bot.\n",
    "#### *Logic*:\n",
    "If a terminal state is reached (e.g., no further moves or maximum depth reached), it evaluates the current state using `evaluate_state` and returns the score.\n",
    "Otherwise, it begins the recursive evaluation by calling the maximizing function `max_eval`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Max eval**\n",
    "The `max_eval` function represents the \"maximizing\" player's (bot's) turn. It tries to maximize the bot's evaluation score by selecting the most favorable move.\n",
    "#### *Logic*:\n",
    "Checks for terminal states or maximum depth, evaluating the game state if true.\n",
    "Separates potential moves into \"moves\" (actions taken by the active Pokémon) and \"switches\" (changing the active Pokémon).\n",
    "Sorts moves based on their evaluation score and appends the best switch, if available.\n",
    "Simulates each move:\n",
    "Saves the current state (deepcopy).\n",
    "Applies the move and recursively calls the minimizing function `min_eval` for the opponent's turn.\n",
    "Restores the state after simulation.\n",
    "Updates alpha with the highest evaluation score.\n",
    "Prunes unnecessary branches if the evaluation exceeds beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Min eval**\n",
    "The `min_eval` function represents the \"minimizing\" player's (opponent's) turn. It tries to minimize the bot's evaluation score by selecting the most detrimental move for the bot.\n",
    "#### *Logic*:\n",
    "Similar to `max_eval`, but it focuses on minimizing the evaluation score.\n",
    "Iterates through the opponent's possible moves, simulating each move and calling `max_eval` recursively for the bot's next turn.\n",
    "Updates beta with the lowest evaluation score.\n",
    "Prunes unnecessary branches if the evaluation is less than or equal to alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features:**\n",
    "- *Alpha-Beta Pruning*: Optimizes the Minimax algorithm by avoiding the evaluation of branches that are guaranteed to be suboptimal. This reduces the computational cost.\n",
    "- *Recursive State Evaluation*: Alternates between maximizing and minimizing turns, simulating potential moves for both the bot and its opponent.\n",
    "- *Move Sorting*: The bot prioritizes moves based on their evaluation scores, improving the efficiency of the algorithm.\n",
    "- *State Management*: Uses deepcopy to save and restore the battle state during simulations, ensuring that no permanent changes affect subsequent evaluations.\n"

    "# Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the preliminary results that were already presented during the in-class presentation. The results are divided by the generation of Pokémon used to generate the random team.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pokémon Showdown, player performance is evaluated using **five key metrics**: **Elo**, **GXE**, **Glicko-1**, **W (Wins)**, and **L (Losses)**. Each metric provides insight into a player's skill, consistency, and match outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **1. Elo Rating**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** The primary rating system used to assess a player's skill level.\n",
    "- **Mechanism:** Your Elo rating **increases with wins** and **decreases with losses**.\n",
    "- **Starting Point:** Every player starts with a base rating of **1000**.\n",
    "- **K-Factor Scaling:** Determines how much the rating changes after a match:\n",
    "   - **1100–1299:** K = 50  \n",
    "   - **1300–1599:** K = 40  \n",
    "   - **1600 and above:** K = 32  \n",
    "- **Rating Floor:** The minimum rating is capped at **1000**.\n",
    "- **Rating Decay:** Players with a rating above **1400** experience **daily rating decay** if they play fewer than **5 games per day**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  *Higher Elo signifies better performance on the ladder.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **2. GXE (Glicko X-Act Estimate)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** An estimate of the **probability of winning** against an average ladder opponent.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** A **higher GXE** means a higher chance of winning.\n",
    "   - Example: A GXE of **75%** indicates a **75% chance of victory** against a standard opponent.\n",
    "- **Calculation:** Derived from the **Glicko rating system**, factoring in both rating and rating deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  *GXE provides a quick understanding of your expected performance in matches.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **3. Glicko-1 Rating**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** A rating system that evaluates skill along with **uncertainty** (rating deviation).\n",
    "- **Components:**\n",
    "   - **Rating (R):** Represents player skill (starts at **1500**).\n",
    "   - **Rating Deviation (RD):** Reflects confidence in the rating. A **lower RD** indicates higher confidence.\n",
    "- **Mechanism:** Updated daily based on match outcomes.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - A **high rating** with a **low RD** means a strong and reliable performance.\n",
    "   - A **high RD** suggests that more matches are needed for an accurate assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  *Glicko-1 offers both a rating and a confidence measure in player performance.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **4. W (Wins)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** The **total number of matches won** by the player.\n",
    "- **Significance:** A higher number of wins indicates **experience** and **successful gameplay**.\n",
    "- **Context:** Wins directly contribute to **improving Elo and GXE scores**.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  *Wins are essential for climbing the ladder and maintaining high ratings.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  **5. L (Losses)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** The **total number of matches lost** by the player.\n",
    "- **Significance:** A higher number of losses might indicate **inconsistency** or **areas for improvement**.\n",
    "- **Context:** Consecutive losses can significantly **reduce Elo and GXE scores**.\n",

    "In the final results of our Pokémon battle project, we observed a notable performance improvement after utilizing the genetic algorithm to optimize the constant value in the evaluate_state function through its recombination property. This optimization enhanced the bot's decision-making and battle strategies. \n",
    "When testing our bot on the 6th and 7th generation games, we saw a significant increase in win rates compared to previous results. In the 6th generation, the bot's win rate improved from 37.3% to 44%, while in the 7th generation, it increased from 39% to 52%. Additionally, when testing our bot on the 8th and 9th generation games, it outperformed its performance in the 6th and 7th generations, primarily due to the updated damage calculation mechanics in these later generations. However, the absence of Teracristal in the 9th generation limited our ability to fully optimize its potential."

    "We set the hyperparameter for max_depth to 18. This choice was intentional, as 18 is a multiple of 6, which corresponds to the number of Pokémon on a team. This configuration allows the algorithm to simulate three moves ahead, aligning with our strategic objective to win efficiently within three moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to depth 18, we experimented with depths of 6, 12, and 24. While we observed that performance improved with greater depth, exceeding 18 made the algorithm noticeably slower in searching for the optimal move, introducing significant delays due to time constraints. Therefore, a depth of 18 strikes a balance between performance and computational feasibility, effectively addressing the timer issue."
